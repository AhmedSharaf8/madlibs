#Madlib
madlib = f"Today, my fabulous camp group went to a (an)\
{adj_1} amusement park. It was a\
fun park with lots of cool {noun_1}\
and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my\
kind counselor shouted loudly, \"Everybody off the\
{noun_2}.\" We all pushed out in a terrible\
hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and\
we scurried in. I was so excited! I couldn't figure out\
what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller\
coaster I really liked so, I {adv_1} ran\
over to get in the long line that had about\
{num_1} people in it. When I finally\
got on the roller coaster I was {verb_1}. In fact I was so nervous my two knees\
were knocking together. This was the {adj_2} ride I had ever been on! In about two\
minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears.\
Thatâ€™s when the ride began! When I got to the bottom,\
I was a little {verb_2} but I\
was proud of myself. The rest of the day went\
{adv_2}. It was a(n) {adj_3} day at the fun park."
